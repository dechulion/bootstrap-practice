        <h3>Above are just 4 pics each placed within a class="col-md-3" so they take up about a quarter of the page. Each grid has it's own padding that I had to manually remove. The img's themselves have different classes which give them the altered shape.</h3>

        <h4>Alternatively I can use a grid to write a ton of text and float in image next to it. Of course I could put the image in another grid, but that's not as much fun. So here's lots of text. Lorim ipsum, why the hell does that look like latin but isn't latin, it makes me look really smart to people who have no idea what they are looking at, otherwise it's just a bunch of babble. Granted this is all babble too, but at least a person can read it and possibly be entertained by the compete idiocy of it all. But then again, I really don't know. I just keep typing because I want lots of text. Actually not sure how much text I need. I'ts going to spread out and span the width of the grid. I could always put this in a smaller grid, but the next size smaller is probably too small. This should be good. And yes I know the picture's washed out, I did that for a different project and am too lazy to grab the original off the internet. <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></h4>
